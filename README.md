# Open Earbuds

It is a free and open source project in which an earbuds is implemented. Earbuds are most useful electronic gadgets nowadays. Older version used wires to transfer sound data, but newer version use a wireless communication. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is the used wireless communication. It is really suitable for sound streaming. From an electronic engineer's view, it is really hard to design a small, low power and battery operated device which can be used inside ears. It has lots of challenges. This project is a guide for ones who want to know the basics of Earbuds.

#### Introduction

Earbuds are the most innovative electronic device, because they have lots of amazing features such as: low profile, low power and art design. Earbuds design has lots of challenges. The design has both electronic and mechanical aspects. It must be small enough to put inside ears easily and also it should have nice view. Because it uses battery, being low power is really important. Beside, the board space is too low. So, low profile low power component selection is really important. For wireless communication, the BLE should be used. It is convenient and all phones support it. BLE antenna design is a big challenge. Chip antenna and antenna on PCB is the two possible ways. Because of limited space, chip antenna is better.
